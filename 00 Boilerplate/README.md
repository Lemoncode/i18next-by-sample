## 00 Boilerplate

In this sample we are going to setup a web project that can be easily managed
by webpack.

We will setup an initial npm project, give support to ES6, and install webpack.

We will create a `hellword.js` sample.

Summary steps:
 - Intialize `package.json` (npm init)
 - Create a simple HTML file.
